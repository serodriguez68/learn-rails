# Startup Rails Application

This app can be used for a soon-to-be-launched startup page.
It invites the visitors to join a newsletter through Mailchimp, stores the information of sign ups in a google sheet (using google drives's API) and allows visitors to send you an email through a form.

The app is great to take a look to how all of the following concepts come together in a single web app:
- MVC software architecture
- Ruby on Rails development
- Integration with Foundation 5 front-end framework
- Integration with third-party API's (mailchimp, google drive, segmente.io, google analytics)
- Porject planning through user stories
- Version control with git
- Deployment to Heroku

## Installation
- (1) Set up a local rails development environment.
- (2) Download the repo
- (3) cd to the project root folder
- (4) run 'bundle install --without production' in your terminal
- (5) Start rails server ('rails server' in terminal)
- (6) Open a browser and go to localhost:3000

## Credits
This is app was made following the "Learn Rails book" by DanielKehoe (Great Book by the way).
